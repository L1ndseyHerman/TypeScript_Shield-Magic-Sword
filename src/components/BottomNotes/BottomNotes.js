                If you are a software developer who wants to look at 
                previous versions, you can go to
                my <a href="https://github.com/L1ndseyHerman/New_Shield_Magic_Sword/">
                GitHub</a>, change the branch from &quot;master&quot; to the version 
                you are looking for, then pull the code and run it in VS Code.
